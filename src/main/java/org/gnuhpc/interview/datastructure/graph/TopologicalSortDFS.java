Topological Sort:
A topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is
a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv
from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.
A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles,
that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Please note that there can be more than one solution for topological sort.

/*
 We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph.
 In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. '
 In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack.
  We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately,
  we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices,
  then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of stack.
  Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices
  (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
